#### Created by: Steven Chang, Alexandra Purcarea, Pradnesh Sanderan and Jonathan Gustafsson Frennert. 

Android application written in native Java for sustainable travelling via Google Maps, OpenTripMap and OpenWeatherMap API integrations. This application curates the most sustainable recreational activities that tourists can get in their vicinity! even considering the weather! This is the only app you will ever need!

#### Description
When travellers first comes to a unknown city, they probably won't be that familiar with the local weather which might potentially affect their travel plan (eg. Climb the Arthur Seat when it's rainy), so our app can detects the climate based on three index: weather, temperature and wind speed to recommend the suitable attractions (categorized in to indoor and outdoor) for the travellers to visit.

#### TODO: 
 * merge side branch to incorporate mindful banner at the start of the app 
 * add 'heat map' functionality (changing the color of the markers)
 * improve markdown
 * add information for buidings using web scraper (?)
