#### Created by: Steven Chang, Alexandra Purcarea, Pradnesh Sanderan and Jonathan Gustafsson Frennert. 

#### Android application written in native Java for sustainable travelling via Google Maps, OpenTripMap and OpenWeatherMap API integrations. This application curates the most sustainable recreation that tourists can get in Edinburgh, even taking into account the weather! This is the only app you will ever need!

#### TODO: merge side branch to incorporate mindful banner at the start of the app, add 'heat map' functionality (changing the color of the markers).
